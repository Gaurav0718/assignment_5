Tasks in module 6

Task 1
# 🎓 Student Marks Lookup

This Python script allows you to **check a student's marks** by entering their name.

## 🧾 Features

* Stores a list of students and their marks using a Python dictionary.
* Accepts user input for a student's name.
* Displays the marks if the student is found.
* Handles case formatting (capitalizes the first letter) for better matching.
* Returns a "Student not found" message if the name doesn't exist in the list.

## 🛠 How to Use

1. Run the script in a Python environment.
2. Enter the student's name when prompted.
3. View the corresponding marks, or a message if the student is not found.

## 📌 Example

```
Enter the student's name: yashas  
Yashas's marks: 88
```

Task 2

# 🔁 Extract and Reverse First Five Elements from a List

This Python script demonstrates how to extract the first five elements from a list and reverse them.

## 🧾 Description

The script:

1. Initializes a list of numbers from 1 to 10.
2. Extracts the **first five elements** using list slicing.
3. Reverses the extracted elements **in-place** using the `.reverse()` method.
4. Prints all steps for clarity.

## 🛠 How to Use

1. Copy the script into a `.py` file (e.g., `reverse_first_five.py`).
2. Run it using Python 3:

   ```bash
   python reverse_first_five.py
   ```

## 📌 Example Output

```
Original list: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Extracted first five elements: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Reversed extracted elements: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
```

## 💡 Concepts Covered

* List slicing (`list[:5]`)
* In-place list reversal (`list.reverse()`)
* Formatted string output (`f""`)
